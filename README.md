### Description:
This app was designed using React and CSS to be a one stop shop for my information. There are several section starting with "About Me". This section features a photo, links to relevant sites and resume, as well as a short bio. The next section involves "My Experience", which outlines the languages and tools I have worked with. "Projects" features four recent projects with links to the Github and deployed app. "References" houses three different references: Seth Gunnells is a Software Engineer 4 with Asurion, Tierney Allen was a fellow student, and Amy Gonzalez is my current employer. Lastly, there is a mailto link to email me directly.

### Usage:
This app is used to promote my bio, skills, and references.
